- Render.com account (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of web development

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code

1. **Fork or clone this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Ensure all files are committed** to your repository
3. **Verify the file structure** matches the expected layout:

```
barnum-stem-portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ render.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html

    â”œâ”€â”€ js/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard.js
    â””â”€â”€ uploads/
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Render

### 2.1 Create a New Web Service

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign in
2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Web Service"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select your `barnum-stem-portfolio` repository

### 2.2 Configure the Service

Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration, but verify these settings:

- **Name**: `barnum-stem-portfolio`
- **Runtime**: `Python 3`
- **Build Command**: 
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  flask db upgrade
  ```
- **Start Command**: 
  ```bash
  gunicorn app:app
  ```

### 2.3 Environment Variables

Render will automatically set these from `render.yaml`:
- `FLASK_APP=app.py`
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `SECRET_KEY` (auto-generated)
- `DATABASE_URL` (from the database service)

### 2.4 Create the Database

1. In your Render dashboard, click **"New +"** â†’ **"PostgreSQL"**
2. Name it: `barnum-stem-db`
3. Select the **Free** plan
4. Click **"Create Database"**
5. Copy the **External Database URL** for later use

## Step 3: Deploy and Test

### 3.1 Deploy the Application

1. Click **"Create Web Service"** in Render
2. Wait for the build to complete (5-10 minutes)
3. Your app will be available at: `https://barnum-stem-portfolio.onrender.com`

### 3.2 Test the Application

1. **Visit your live site** and verify it loads
2. **Test the login** with demo credentials:
   - Teacher: `teacher` / `password123`
   - Student: `emma_k` / `student123`
3. **Check all pages** load correctly
4. **Test project creation** functionality

## Step 4: Post-Deployment Setup

### 4.1 Change Default Passwords

**IMPORTANT**: Change the default passwords immediately!

1. Log in as teacher (`teacher` / `password123`)
2. Go to Teacher Dashboard
3. Update user passwords through the admin interface
4. Create new student accounts with secure passwords

### 4.2 Add Real Content

1. **Create your classes** using the "Manage Classes" section
2. **Add lesson plans** for each quarter
3. **Create sample projects** to showcase the platform
4. **Update the About page** with your information

### 4.3 Customize the Branding

1. **Update the site title** in `templates/base.html`
2. **Modify colors** in `static/css/custom.css`
3. **Add your school logo** to the navigation
4. **Update contact information** in the About page

## Step 5: Share with Students and Parents

### 5.1 Student Access

1. Create student accounts for each student
2. Share login credentials with students
3. Provide the public URL for parents to view projects

### 5.2 Parent Access

1. Share the public showcase URL
2. Parents can view all public projects without logging in
3. Consider creating a parent newsletter with project highlights

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check that all files are committed to GitHub
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Check Render build logs for specific errors

**Database Connection Issues**
- Ensure the database service is running
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- Check database credentials in Render dashboard

**App Crashes on Startup**
- Check the application logs in Render
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure the database is accessible

**Static Files Not Loading**
- Check that the `static/` directory is included
- Verify file paths in templates are correct
- Clear browser cache

### Getting Help

1. **Check Render logs** in your dashboard
2. **Review the application logs** for error messages
3. **Test locally** using the same environment variables
4. **Contact support** if issues persist

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Monitor student progress** through the teacher dashboard
2. **Backup the database** regularly (Render provides automatic backups)
3. **Update dependencies** periodically for security
4. **Review and feature student projects** regularly

### Scaling Considerations

- **Free tier limits**: 750 hours/month, 512MB RAM
- **Upgrade to paid** for more resources if needed
- **Database backups** are automatic on paid plans
- **Custom domains** available on paid plans
